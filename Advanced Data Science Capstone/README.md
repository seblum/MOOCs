![](https://github.com/seblum/Coursera/blob/master/Advanced%20Data%20Science%20Capstone/coverpage.jpg)

This repository is the final project implementation for the IBM Advanced Data science certification on coursera. The aim of the project is to develop a data science  "product" on a dataset of own choice. 


This work implements a sentiment analysis for financial news to classify headlines of financial news from the perspective of a retail investor. This will contribute to making the right choice on brokerage. The dataset is found on Kaggle 

The project can be divided into five parts. 
1. Data investigation 
2. Feature engineering
3. Model training 
4. Evaluation
5. Results

The main goal of this project is to explain the user actions that contribute to the sentiment analysis using a LSTM RNN. Additionally, a SVC has been implemented as a reference on how the main model performs. 

Below the organization of the files are explained
