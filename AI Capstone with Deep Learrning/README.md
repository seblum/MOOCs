# AI Capstone project for deep learning

This repository is the final assignment for the implementation for the IBM AI Capstone project for deep learning certification on coursera. The aim of this capstone is to build an image classifier and compare and evaluate a VGG16 pre-trained model with a ResNet50 pre-trained model.

The project can be divided into three parts. 
1. Train model VGG16
2. Performance evaluation of VGG16 and ResNet50
3. Prediction on both models and comparison
